# Redspot

---

Redspot is named after Jupiter's Great Red Spot, which is also the largest DOT in the solar system. Redspot's target project is [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) in Truffle Suite. Redspot is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for `pallet-contracts`. Redspot is trying to let the development of ink! be projectized and simplify the testing and interacting with contracts.

We think Redspot needs to be a flexible system for the reason that `pallet-contracts` would be integrated to any substrate chain with some partial modification. Thus we decide using [hardhat](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat) as Redspot core architecture for it has an outstanding design to allow developer using plugins to add new features.

Therefore, we establish our project on the hardhat core framework and modify it a lot to suit substrate under MIT licence. In future, Redspot would build more features based on this forked hardhat core.

This project is used for contracts developer, if developers want to deploy and test on a blockchain, we advice developer to use "jupiter" blockchain, which is a open testnet for substrate pallet-contracts. Better than that, jupiter also provide a develop type node, that could very easily for testing contracts.
